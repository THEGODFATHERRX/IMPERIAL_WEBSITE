				Since december 2010 to may 2012, the server cost me a total of $2050 which I ran without asking anything back.<br>
				Since may, I have decided to leave the server over to the community to run itself. It will be paid for by its players, but I will still maintain it with the time I have left.
				<p>It needs at least $85 a month to continue running. If this won't be reached, I only might be able to fill up. Although I haven't been needing to do that since may, and hopefully it can remain this way.</p>
				This is absolutely profit free for me, and the paypal account is automated to pay the ISP which I bought specifically for this server. I get nothing from it other than not having to pay the entire expensive bill.
				It is possible to be rewarded for your donations, check the Rewards tab.

							<div class="post-content">
								The Minecraft server ip is 2b2t.org. It has since december 2010 been hosted on the same world, with vanilla being focused on with no rules and pvp enabled.	
								Being left like this for over two years now, the world is ravaged and scattered with ruins, with over 40,000 different players hitting on it since august 2011.
								The world is currently 468 GB, 24 months old and with 43,128 players saved. (Last updated 9th march 2013)

								<div class="post-header">Garry's Mod</div>
								<div class="post-content">
								The Garry's Mod server ip is www.2b2t.org (you have to include the www. due to how source engine works). Its focus is on simple sandbox and building, and it runs without Wiremod to encourage more building rather than putting chips and wires on small PHX plates. Server is currently down due to no interest.
								</div>
								<div class="spacer3"></div>
								<div class="post-header">Mumble</div>
								<div class="post-content">
								Mumble is a free voice chatting program which is very easy to use and has good quality. The ip is 2b2t.org with default port 64738. The server is set up with a channel which allows custom public and private rooms to be created, and the server can be used for anything.
